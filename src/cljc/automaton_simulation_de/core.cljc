  "Simulation is a technique that mimics a real system - and simplifies it, to learn something useful about it.
Discrete event simulation is modeling a real system with discrete events

* Contains a user-specific domain, constraints, a customer-specific state and events modeling and an option to render visually the effects.
* Customer simulation can use directly `DE Simulation` or a library that eases the modeling: `rc modeling`, `industry modeling`, â€¦ ")

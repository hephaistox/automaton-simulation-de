  "A scheduler snapshot is a consistent set of data for the scheduler.
It is containing the simulation state, past events and  future events and iteration number scheduler snapshot is identified with an id property and is related to exactly one date.  Past and Future events are sorted collection of events.

Remarks:
* An entity using the scheduler snapshot should not access past or future events to have some information on the state the simulation.

  "Scheduler snapshot is a map containing:
   * `id` - Unique identificator of an scheduler snapshot.  It is in a one to one relationship with a scheduler snapshot (so it acts like an id of that scheduler snapshot in the context of a scheduler play) in the context scheduler.
   * `iteration` - A counter of scheduler iteration. By convention, the counter is starting at 0.
   * `date` - Defines the date where that scheduler-snapshot happens
   * `state` - State modified by the event
   * `past-events` - Collection of a past event. A past event is event that has already been executed, so its date is in the past. A past event cannot be modified anymore (i.e. it is immutable).
   * `future-events` - Collection of a future event. A future event is an event that has not been executed yet, so its date is in the future. A future event may be updated during the simulation - its date may change, its data may change or it could be cancelled (i.e. itâ€™s a mutable event)"
